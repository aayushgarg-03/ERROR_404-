**Farmers** are the backbone of any country. 
If the farmer is rich, then so is the nation. Our project is a small tribute to these founders of human civilization without whom our survival is unimaginable. Lal Bahadur Shastri once said,"Jai Kisan via Jai Vigyan". We're trying to reinvent the wheel with:

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
- To contribute towards Digital India Mission. 
- 1.4 Billion New users will be added on the Internet by 2022.

## EXISTING PROBLEMS 
![Problems](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/04/25/19/36/farmer-2260636__480.jpg)
- Indian Economy is still Largely dependent on agriculture with over 51% of the workforce dependent on it. 
- However, due to continuous neglect, this sector is today in dire need of support. A total of 2,96,438 farmers have committed suicides since 1995. 
- Crop failure, debt burden, and falling into the trap of middlemen has become a common phenomenon for Indian Farmers. 
- Price disparity in different parts of the country. 
- For example, in 2015, onions sold in Delhi were twice as expensive as that sold in Nagpur. 

## OUR SOLUTION 
![Solution](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/04/06/06/04/farmers-1311017__480.jpg)
- We believe TECHNOLOGY is a means to empower the downtrodden and bridge the gap between hope and opportunity. 
- In accordance with the "DIGITAL INDIA MISSION", our aim is to develop an app that will use the revolutionary idea of machine learning to tell the farmers about the best crop they can grow. 
- We will collect the prices of the past 5 years of different crop varities and along with the data provided by meteorological dept. for weather, we will tell the farmers about the best crop variety they can grow for ‘MAXIMUM PROFIT’. 
- To counter Price desparity, we will dynamically inform the farmers about the demands of various cities on a daily basis so that they can sell their produce at the best rate. 
- We are going to create a responsive website which 
will connect traders to farmers sitting in different cities to ensure that the farmer gets the best price possible. 
- A personalized app where we’ll inform the farmers about latest farming techniques such as irrigation techniques, pest control, organic farming etc. And ways by which they can maximize their profit.
