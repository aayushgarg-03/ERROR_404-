**Farmers** are the backbone of any country. 
If the farmer is rich, then so is the nation. Our project is a small tribute to these founders of human civilization without whom our survival is unimaginable. Lal Bahadur Shastri once said,"Jai Kisan via Jai Vigyan". We're trying to reinvent the wheel with:

- Indian Economy is still Largely dependent on agriculture with **over 51% of the workforce dependent on it**. 
- However, due to continuous neglect, this sector is today in dire need of support.**A total of 2,96,438 farmers have committed suicides since 1995.** 
- Crop failure, debt burden, and falling into the trap of middlemen has become a common phenomenon for Indian Farmers. 
- **Price disparity** in different parts of the country. 
- For example, in 2015, onions sold in Delhi were twice as expensive as that sold in Nagpur. 

## OUR SOLUTION 
![Solution](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/04/06/06/04/farmers-1311017__480.jpg)
- We believe **TECHNOLOGY** is a means to empower the downtrodden and bridge the gap between hope and opportunity. 
- In accordance with the **"DIGITAL INDIA MISSION"**, our aim is to develop an app that will use the revolutionary idea of machine learning to tell the farmers about the best crop they can grow. 
- We will collect the prices of the past 5 years of different crop varities and along with the data provided by **meteorological dept. for weather**, we will tell the farmers about the best crop variety they can grow for **‘MAXIMUM PROFIT’**. 
- To counter **Price desparity**, we will dynamically inform the farmers about the demands of various cities on a daily basis so that they can sell their produce at the best rate. 
- We are going to create a **responsive website** which will connect traders to farmers sitting in different cities to ensure that the farmer gets the best price possible. 
- A **personalized app** where we’ll inform the farmers about latest farming techniques such as irrigation techniques, pest control, organic farming etc. And ways by which they can maximize their profit.
